# emon_Suite
Arduino based home electricity and temperature monitoring
These libraries are based on much of the work from the [Open Energy Monitor project](https://openenergymonitor.org) which in turn was based on the JeeNode and [JeeLib libraries](https://github.com/jeelabs/jeelib) for low power and RFM12b/RFM69 support.
